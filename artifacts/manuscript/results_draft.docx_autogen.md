**Assessing High-Resolution CubeSat Imagery and Machine Learning for
Detailed, High Resolution Snow-Covered Area.** Anthony F. Cannistra,
Nicoleta Cristea.

**Section X:** *Results*

Here we divide the evaluation of our snow classification model into
three assessment frames. We first show that a model fitted with data
from the Upper Tuolumne Basin, California, USA (see Section X) produces
snow classifications in alignment with other state of the art snow
observing methods when assessed using out-of-sample data also from
Tuolumne. Second, we find comparable performance when assessing the same
model (fitted with Tuolumne data) using out-of-basin data from the
Gunnison River/East River Basin, Colorado USA (see Section X). Third, we
show that our model has promise in its ability to fill temporal data
gaps in other remotely-sensed snow cover products.

**X.1**: *Classification Performance*

**X.1.1**: *Upper Tuolumne Basin, CA, USA*

Coming soon.

**X.1.2**: *Gunnison River Basin, CO, USA*

We evaluate the out-of-basin model performance of the Tuolumne Basin
snow classification model using a single Planet Labs, Inc imagery
collection in the Upper Gunnison/East River Basin, Colorado, USA (Figure
X2; Panel A. Image *20180524*\_172637\_0f2d), paired with a
contemporaneous ASO collection (ASO/NSIDC ID:
ASO\_3M\_SD\_USCOGE\_*20180524*). When comparing against binary ASO
ground-truth snow cover, the out-of-basin model performs as well or
better than two other comparably high resolution snow cover products
(Landsat 8 fSCA and Sentinel-2 NDSI, see Section X) across all four
computed classification metrics (Figure X1; red bars).

**Figure X1:** Out-of-basin model performance of the Tuolumne Basin snow
classification model in the Upper Gunnison/East River Basin, Colorado,
USA (red bars) is as good or better than two other high-resolution snow
cover data products (blue bars). These metrics are computed using ASO
ground truth snow classification at ASO (3 meter) resolution (all
products are interpolated to 3 meter resolution for comparison).

However, the Tuolumne model exhibits patterns of systematic
misclassification in constrained geographic regions in the out-of-basin
image sample (Figure X2, Panel D). In particular, the model fails to
accurately identify snow-covered regions in low-elevation or densely
forested regions (Figure X2; Panel D, red regions.). Smaller regions of
inaccurate classification exist in rocky alpine areas, where the
Tuolumne model misidentifies snow-free regions as snow-covered (Figure
X2; Panel D, blue regions).

model (**B**) show both agreement and systematic divergence (difference

**X.2**: *Temporal Gap-Filling*

To evaluate the potential of this approach to fill temporal observation
gaps in other snow covered area products, we compare relative departure
from an ASO-derived fSCA observation between our model classifications
and the snow cover classifications of a temporally sparse dataset. This
measure is computed by averaging the high-resolution binary product
(ASO, ML) to a coarser resolution matching the temporally-sparse data
product being compared, see Methods.
