    "# Step X: Configure Amazon Sagemaker and Train Model\n",
    "\n",
    "Amazon Sagemaker is a managed machine learning service which allows us to easily experiment with different configurations of input data without having to worry about the computational infrastructure involved in training a complex model on large volumes of data. We use this tool to produce our trained models. \n",
    "\n",
    "Sagemaker works by ingesting a pre-packaged set of **training and inference code**, along with the necessary environment, and running this package on hardware you specify. This package comes in the form of a Docker container. We have created this container such that it contains all of our custom ML code (you can see the specification in `../pipeline/sagemaker/Dockerfile`), and it lives in the Amazon Elastic Container Registry with the following tag: `675906086666.dkr.ecr.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/planet-snowcover:latest`. This container is not publicly accessible, but is accessible to anyone with AWS credentials. \n",

    "In order to tell the AWS machinery knows who you are, you must specify your AWS profile name, which describes a set of credentials configured via the AWS command line interface. If you've run `aws configure`, you'll have an AWS credentials file containing your credentials, most likely under the `default` profile. Running the following cell will tell you which profile names have associated credentials currently configured on your computer. ⚠️ **Note**: if the following cell has no output, you don't have AWS credentials configured. Go back to the [Deployment Guide](../deployment/README.md) to learn how to do this."
